To compile:
  g++ -o LJDecompTest LJDecompTest.cpp
  g++ -o 3NFSyn 3NFSyn.cpp
  g++ -o BCNFSyn BCNFSyn.cpp
To run the program: 
  ./LJDecompTest
  ./3NFSyn
  ./BCNFSyn
- I have added a few test cases in "in" folder.
- If this program is being run on a linux system,
  use bash <script_name> to compile and test the code.
- The bash script for each program will compile the source file,  
  and then it will run it against the testcases in "in" folder.
